# Virus Simulation


This project, developed in JavaFX, presents a simulation of virus spread within a defined area. It features dynamic units (individuals) that move around and can exist in various states: healthy, infected with symptoms, asymptomatic, or immune. The simulation incorporates the Memento design pattern, enabling users to save and restore the state of the simulation at any point in time, providing full control and the ability to analyze different scenarios.

The visualization offers an intuitive and interactive interface, with real-time updates reflecting the spread and progression of the virus. Units' interactions and transitions between states are governed by configurable parameters, such as infection rate, recovery time, and movement patterns. This allows users to experiment with different conditions and observe the effects on the simulated population.

The project is ideal for educational purposes, providing insights into the mechanics of disease spread and the importance of factors such as immunity and asymptomatic carriers. It combines engaging visuals with practical functionality, showcasing the capabilities of JavaFX and the Memento design pattern in a real-world-inspired application.
